# The Electronic Pendulum by Arttu Lahti for Tampere University
This is the repository used to share important files and information on the Electronic pendulum BSc project. You can find the demo pendulum's 3D models, wiring diagram and parts list (with links) here. I also uploaded the Arduino scripts I used for my normal oscillation demos (both continuous and damped). The thesis itself is also here as a PDF file.

You're free to use and modify these files however you want, according to the MIT license (found in LICENSE.md).

Enjoy!
