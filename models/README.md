# Models folder
This folder contains the 3D models for the demo pendulum. Created using Autodesk Fusion 360.

The STL folder includes the models for the structure of the demo pendulum, ready for 3D printing if needed. The STP folder includes the 3D model files for editing, if you do not have the same parts at hand as the demo did.
Fusion 360 was used to create them, but .stp files can be edited with any 3D design software.
